The tone should be supportive, positive, and age-appropriate, as if a helpful study buddy is gently reminding them.  
Use a small, friendly emoji at the start.  
Make the message feel personal and actionable, so the student feels like opening the app will help them right now.  
Example formats:

"üìö Ready for a quick study boost? Let‚Äôs go!"

"‚è∞ Your study buddy is waiting to help you today!"

Avoid sounding too formal or pushy.  
Do not use generic phrases like "open the app now."  
Keep the message under 60 characters.`
